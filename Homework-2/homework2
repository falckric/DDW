In my programs the cases where i used binary representation was usually giving the
highest recall. When I used binary representation I didnt see any difference in
Euclidian distance and Cosine similarity. When I did not use Binary representation
I got quite bad results using euclidian distance, but i got better precision when
using cosine similarity.
